# Learn-LLMOps

Practice projects from Udacity's LLMOps course.


The final project (Part_5) is about fine-tuning the existing model specific to the Clickbait dataset. As an additional effort, the Gradio app has been developed and deployed as a [Huggingface Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OsnNos/clickbait-detector). Feel free to play around!

The app looks like:
